### Introduction

In this project, we introduce a deep learning algorithm that uses a 2D RGB image as input and synthesizes a set of multi-focus images.
We use a large light field dataset as the training data. it includes 3343 5D light field data mainly containing plant and flower.
our algorithm is different from the other view synthesize method like light field synthesis or View synthesis by geometry estimation.
we use GAN to capture the semantic relations between different focus level images and synthesis multi-focus images.

Before we dive into details, let's first play with the some results! Hit shuffle button to see more!
