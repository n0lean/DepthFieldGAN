### Conclusion and Future Work
We have shown that with training on the large light field dataset, the deep learning model is able to synthesize the  multi-focus images from 
single picture. Since the training dataset only includes flower and plant, the performance of non-flower niches are not very good as that of flower picture, but it is still acceptable.
In the future, we can collect diverse dataset to optimize our model.
